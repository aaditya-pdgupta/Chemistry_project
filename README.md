# Procedure of the experiment

* A clean dry beaker had been taken and added 200 ml of cows's milk into it and also added 20 ml of saturated ammonium sulphate solution slowly and with  stirring, fat along with casein was precipitated out. 
* The solution was filtered and transferred to another beaker. Add about 30 ml of water to the precipitate. Only casein dissolved in water forming a milky solution leaving fat undissolved. 
* The milky solution was heated to about $40 ^{0}$C and added 10\% acetic acid solution drop wise when casein got precipitated. 
* Filter the precipitate, wash with water, and the precipitate was allowed to dry. 
* Weigh the dry solid mass in a previously weigh watch glass.
